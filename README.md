"This project aims at developing a web app using Tkinter. This app will have two features:   First, user will click a wide angle photograph of the class and upload it to the app, the app will detect the faces and will mark attendance of the students present. It will also count the number of students.  Second, the user will upload a photograph and the app can detect the user emotion(Angry, Neutral, Happy, Excited, Sad etc)."
